Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number ap − a is an integer multiple of p. In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as

{\displaystyle a^{p}\equiv a{\pmod {p}}.} a^p \equiv a \pmod p.
For example, if a = 2 and p = 7, then 27 = 128, and 128 − 2 = 126 = 7 × 18 is an integer multiple of 7.

If a is not divisible by p, Fermat's little theorem is equivalent to the statement that ap − 1 − 1 is an integer multiple of p, or in symbols:[1][2]

{\displaystyle a^{p-1}\equiv 1{\pmod {p}}.} a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p.
For example, if a = 2 and p = 7, then 26 = 64, and 64 − 1 = 63 = 7 × 9 is thus a multiple of 7.
